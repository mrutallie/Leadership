## Hi, I'm Mike.




### What is this about?
Have you ever gotten a new leader and wonder what you are in for? What about if you are wondering what a leader is like to work for? I've been there too. That's why I have created this Readme. By the end of it, you should know a little more about me, what I stand for, and what it is like to work with me.

### My Philosophy on Life
My philosophy in life is to constantly move forward and never stop improving. I understand that my success is in large part a result of those who have invested themselves in my life and my career. As a leader, developing relationships with those around me is key to having a positive influence on their lives. I have found that my greatest achievements have been made by focusing on things greater than myself, such as my team and my organization. Each day I am tested as a leader, but in the end, it is about how I have used my influence to help those around me. I will always press forward and raise the bar to challenge myself and those around me to accomplish amazing things; things that matter. 
The four words that best describe me: Integrity, Passion, Leadership, Ingenuity
